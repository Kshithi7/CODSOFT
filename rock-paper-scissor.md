# Project 4: Rock-paper-scissor game 🪨
A simulation of rock-paper-scissor game 2️⃣.
##  Overview ⭐
* This project is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game 🎮 using Python. 
* The simulation allows a user to play multiple rounds against the computer 💻, keeping track of scores and providing clear feedback on each round’s outcome 🔢.
* The user-friendly🖱️interface ensures an enjoyable experience with instructions and prompts.
## Walkthrough 🚶
1. The game starts by importing the necessary random library and defining the possible choices (rock, paper, scissors) ✂️. Scores for both the user and the computer are initialized to zero 0️⃣.
2. The user is prompted to enter⌨️ their choice.
3. The computer randomly selects its choice from the same set of options ◀️.
4. A function compares the user’s choice with the computer’s choice to determine the winner 🥇.
5. The game displays the choices made by both the user👱 and the computer 💻, announces the winner of the round 🥇, and shows the updated scores.
## Challenges 🤔
* Implementing a fair and unbiased random choice generator 🎲 for the computer.
* Keeping an accurate count of the scores 🧮 across multiple rounds.
## Learnings 📑
* Understanding of basic Python concepts such as loops 🔁, conditionals , and functions.
* Use of 'random' module to generate random choices🎲.
## Improvements 📓
Adding more features such as a leaderboard 🏅, different difficulty levels, or additional game modes.
##  The project highlights the importance of  input validation and offers enhanced user interaction and feedback mechanisms
