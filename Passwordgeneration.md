# Project 3: Password generator 🔐
A python script password generator㊙️application that generates random passwords based on the users specifications 💻.
##  Overview ⭐
* Creates a random password based on what the user wants to include: letters 🅰️, numbers 🔢, and symbols❕.
* Random genration of password by importing in-built modules such as random and string 🔡.
## Walkthrough 🚶
- The script imports the random and string modules to access ☑️functions and constants for randomization and character sets 🗳️.
- The main function creates password by intializing a empty string that holds the pool of characters🔠.
- Genrates password by selecting ⚫ the pool characters in random.
## Challenges 🤔
* Ensure that the user inputs correct data type🖱️.
* Handling cases where the user might not select any character sets ✅, which would make password generation impossible.
## Learnings 📑
1. Partioning of code into smaller understandable blocks 🔼.
2. Handling user inputs and providing meaningful feedback👍 enhances the user experience. 
## Improvements 📓
Ensuring the generated password meets certain security criteria 🔐, such as a minimum length or a mix of character types and vulnerability of the generated password.
