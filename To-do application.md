# Project 1: A simple To-Do list application 🔖
Building an all-inclusive to-do list application :memo: with built-in reminder features, enabling task creation, modification, deletion, and live alert tracking.
## Project Overview ⭐
* Build a simple to-do list📱using python.
* Create command-line 🖋️ to create, update and track to-do tasks efficiently and easily.
* Manage 📑 and organize the tasks orderly.

Creating tasks with title, duedate and remainder -> Setting a remainder to complete the task -> Updating the tasks -> Deleting the tasks -> View the tasks created
## Challenges 🤔
* Handling various user inputs, such as incorrect date formats ❗ or invalid task indices .
* Continuously checking for reminders ⏲️ without causing performance issues.
* Ensuring that reminders are set and triggered correctly across different time zones 🌐.
* Designing the application to handle a large number of tasks 📚 and reminders efficiently.
## Learnings 📑
1. Designing and implementing classes 📁 to manage different aspects of the application.
2. Learning how to use threading 🔗 to run multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the main application.
3.  Working with date and time in Python using the datetime module ⏱️.
## Improvements 📓
Save tasks and reminders even after closing the app by using files or databases like SQL or CSV 🗄️.
Let users set task priorities and add options for recurring tasks 🔁.
## These improvements can lead to a more enhanced and efficient to-do list apllication 👍
